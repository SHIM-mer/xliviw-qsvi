            <hr>
            <p>Stanton High Institute of Music (SHIM) was built in 1916, during the height of the "Shimmy" dance craze, which shook the entertainment world by storm. As music and dance rapidly evolved, Principal Flamme—a passionate musician and visionary educator—recognized the need for a dedicated institution to nurture the next generation of artists.</p>
            <p>With her passion for music and dedication to learning, Principal Flamme labored diligently to make SHIM more than an institution. She saw it as a distinguished academy where students could hone their skills, explore various genres, and expand the limits of musical art. Under her guidance, SHIM became renowned for its excellence, and it attracted some of the country's most talented young musicians, composers, and performers.</p>
            <p>The curriculum of the school was structured to be as vibrant as the music industry itself, with a mix of classical training and modern influences. The students were taught not only to master their instruments but also to venture into composition, theory, and performance skills in all genres. From jazz and classical to new modern sounds, SHIM offered a setting where creativity knew no bounds.</p>
            <p>Throughout the years, SHIM became a staple of the music education community, graduating alumni who would become famous musicians, composers, and industry professionals. Although Principal Flamme has long since passed, her legacy remains in the corridors of SHIM, where every note that is played and every song that is written continues to perpetuate her dream of music as an effective force for education, innovation, and artistic liberty.</p>
            <p>Principal Flamme may have been long gone, but that doesn't mean that there won't be a descendant to take her place. We proudly present Principal Nevis for continuing the late Principal Flamme's legacy, where she refined the institution to grow into a better place, having taught prominent celebrity musicians.</p>
